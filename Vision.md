KlusQuest â€” Gamified Chores & Allowance for Dutch Families

Oneâ€‘liner (EN): KlusQuest makes household chores feel like a game, so kids stay motivated and parents stay sane.

Oneâ€‘liner (NL): KlusQuest maakt klussen leuk en overzichtelijk â€” kinderen spelen, ouders houden het overzicht.

Problem

Parents struggle to keep kids (7â€“16) consistently engaged with chores.

Existing apps feel like boring checklists; kids drop off quickly.

Allowance tracking and rewards are fragmented across notes, chats, and memory.

Vision

A playful, modern web app where chores feel like quests: kids earn XP/coins, level up avatars, and claim rewards; parents assign chores and get clarity â€” no nagging required.

Target Market & Languages

Market: Netherlands first; designed to work across EU.

Languages: Bilingual Dutch + English from day one. Copy must be short, emojiâ€‘friendly, and easy to localize.

Product Pillars

Fun for kids â€” progress bars, levels, juicy animations ðŸŽ‰

Stressâ€‘free for parents â€” simple setup, clear status, sane defaults âœ…

Fair rewards â€” coins â†’ rewards, allowance visibility ðŸ’¶

Privacy & safety â€” minimal data, kid PINs, parent control ðŸ”’

Optimize the first session: guided setup â†’ first chore â†’ first reward preview.
